**Problem Statement:**
    Need to use a function (such as `VirtualQuery` or `GetProcAddress`) that is not
    imported by the module.

**High-Level Solution:**
    Patch the Import Address Table (IAT) entry of an unused function to
    point to the function we need.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Identify Unused Function(s):**
    - Open x64dbg and go to: **Symbols** → **Select Module** (auto-selected based on current execution) → Filter by `Type = Imports`.
    - Look for unused imports that can be replaced (e.g., `GetOpenFileNameA` or `GetSaveFileNameA`).

2. **Locate the Function Name in `.idata/.rdata`:**
    - Right-click the selected import and choose **Follow in Dump**.
    - In the dump view, right-click and select **Find Pattern...**.
    - Enter the name of the function in the ASCII search box and double-click the result.

3. **Patch the Function Name:**
    - Replace the name of the unused function (e.g., `GetOpenFileNameA`) with the name of the new function (e.g., `VirtualQuery`).
    - Ensure the new function name is **less than or equal to** the length of the original name.
    - Null-terminate the new name if it’s shorter than the original.

4. **Patch the DLL Name:**
    - Similarly, locate the name of the original DLL (e.g., `COMDLG32.dll`) in the `.idata/.rdata` section.
    - Replace it with the name of the new DLL (e.g., `KERNEL32.dll`).
    - Ensure the new DLL name is **less than or equal to** the length of the original name.
    - Null-terminate the new DLL name if it’s shorter.

6. **Test the Changes:**
    - Restart the application and verify that the patched import is now there and successfully resolved.
    - You should now be able to do `call [<addressOfImport>]` (where `addressOfImport` matches the address in the **Symbols** tab).
